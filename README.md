# Financial Literacy for everyone

This project is an Investment Simulator App built with Jetpack Compose. It provides users with a platform to learn financial literacy while also offering an opportunity to simulate investments in various assets. Users can visualize potential returns over different periods, manage, and track simulated investments interactively.

## Features
- **User Balances and Wallet System:** Each user gets a starting balance upon registration, and they can simulate buying/selling of assets, which are tracked in a wallet system. The app records details such as purchase price and time for each asset.

- **Educational Contents:** This app aims to enhance users' financial literacy by educating them on topics such as debt management, investment instruments, and credit scores. Through interactive simulations and educational content, users can develop a better understanding of financial principles and make informed decisions in their investment journey.

- **Real-Time Crypto and Stock Data:** Fetches live data from the CoinMarketCap API, including information on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others. Data is displayed with essential metrics like price, market cap, and percentage changes over various timeframes.

- **Interactive Portfolio Management:** Users can manage their simulated investments, view their portfolioâ€™s total balance, and track the performance of each asset in real-time.

## Tech Stack
